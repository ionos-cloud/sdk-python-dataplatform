## SDK Python Data Platform v1.0.0

### Overview
This is the first release of the SDK Python Data Platform.
Managed Stackable Data Platform by IONOS Cloud provides a preconfigured Kubernetes cluster with pre-installed and managed Stackable operators. After the provision of these Stackable operators, the customer can interact with them directly and build his desired application on top of the Stackable Platform.


**Note:** Data Platform is currently in the **Early Access (EA)** phase. We recommend keeping usage and testing to non-production critical applications. Please contact your sales representative or support for more information.
